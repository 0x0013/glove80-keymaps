## Installing ü™Ñ

- For the initial flash, use the "bootloader mass storage device mode" method
(see page 31 in the Glove80 User Guide).  Thereafter, use the `&bootloader`
key on any Miryoku layer: hold its thumb key and tap the top outer corner key.

- If you're installing a different firmware version compared to what your
keyboard currently has, then ‚ö†Ô∏è **after flashing both halves** ‚ö†Ô∏è perform a
*configuration factory reset* on both halves (see page 36 in the Glove80 User
Guide) and then toggle the per-key RGB effects first on and then off. ‚ö°  This
allows the newly installed firmware to take full effect. üíØ

## Upgrading üíπ

- Copy the ZMK snippet from the "Custom Defined Behaviors" text box in either
keymap linked above and paste into yours.  The contents of that text box are
also available in the `*.dtsi` files provided in this Git repository.

- You can diff and copy changes between a JSON export of your keymap (via
"Advanced Settings" > "Enable local config" then go back to "Edit" and click
"Download") and the `*.json` files provided in this Git repository.
